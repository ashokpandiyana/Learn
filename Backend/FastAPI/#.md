# FastAPI Complete Learning Roadmap (Beginner → Production-Ready)

---

## 0. Prerequisites (Python & Web Basics)

- **Python Foundations**

  - Variables, functions, modules, virtualenv, pip/uv/poetry
  - Type hints (`typing`, `dataclasses`)
  - Error handling (`try/except`, custom exceptions)
  - Basic OOP (classes, inheritance, composition)
  - Async basics: `async/await`, `asyncio`
  - **Important:** FastAPI is heavily type-driven and async-oriented. Comfort with type hints and async is mandatory.

- **Web & HTTP Basics**
  - HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
  - Status codes: 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
  - Headers, query params, path params, body, cookies
  - JSON, form-data, multipart uploads
  - **Important:** Interviewers often ask you to design/justify REST endpoints and status codes.

---

## 1. FastAPI Fundamentals

- **What is FastAPI**

  - Key features: speed, async, type hints, automatic docs
  - Comparison with Flask/Django
  - ASGI vs WSGI (high-level)
  - **Important:** Be able to explain why a team would choose FastAPI.

- **Project Setup**

  - Installing FastAPI & Uvicorn
  - Creating first `app = FastAPI()`
  - Running with `uvicorn main:app --reload`
  - Basic folder structure:
    - `app/main.py`
    - `app/api/`
    - `app/models/`
    - `app/core/`
  - **Important:** For production apps, separating “core” config and “api” routes is standard.

- **Routing Basics**
  - Path operations: `@app.get`, `@app.post`, `@app.put`, `@app.delete`, `@app.patch`
  - Path parameters (`/items/{item_id}`)
  - Query parameters (`/search?term=abc&page=1`)
  - Default values & optional params
  - Route naming & tags
  - **Important:** Understand how FastAPI matches routes and orders them.

---

## 2. Request & Response Modeling with Pydantic

- **Pydantic Models**

  - `BaseModel` basics
  - Field types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `datetime`, `UUID`
  - Nested models & lists
  - Aliases and `Field` metadata
  - **Important:** Almost all serious FastAPI code uses Pydantic models for both input and output.

- **Request Bodies**

  - Defining request schemas for POST/PUT/PATCH
  - Combining body with path/query params
  - Form & multipart data (file uploads)
  - `Body`, `Form`, `File`, `UploadFile`
  - **Important:** Know when FastAPI reads from query vs body (and how to override).

- **Response Models**
  - `response_model` parameter
  - Hiding fields from responses (`response_model_exclude`, `include`)
  - Using `Config` (`orm_mode` / `from_attributes` in Pydantic v2)
  - Error responses and custom schemas
  - **Important:** For production, explicit response models give better guarantees and docs.

---

## 3. Path Operation Details & Validation

- **Path, Query, Header, Cookie Parameters**

  - `Path`, `Query`, `Header`, `Cookie` objects
  - Validations (min_length, max_length, regex, ge, le, etc.)
  - Defaults & required parameters
  - **Important:** Interviewers may ask “How do you validate parameters without writing manual if-conditions?”

- **Request Lifecycle & Order of Evaluation**

  - Dependency injection evaluation
  - Middleware vs dependencies vs event handlers
  - **Important:** Knowing when each hook runs is crucial for logging, auth, and DB session handling.

- **Custom Responses**
  - `JSONResponse`, `PlainTextResponse`, `HTMLResponse`, `StreamingResponse`, `FileResponse`
  - Returning `Response` directly (manually setting status code, headers, cookies)
  - **Important:** For file downloads, streaming large content, or custom content-types, you must use appropriate response classes.

---

## 4. Dependency Injection in Depth

- **Basic Dependencies**

  - `Depends` usage
  - Functional dependencies vs class-based
  - Scopes: per-request, “sub-dependencies”
  - **Important:** Dependency injection is one of FastAPI’s core strengths; be able to design re-usable dependencies.

- **Common Dependency Patterns**

  - Auth dependency (get current user)
  - DB session dependency
  - Settings/config dependency
  - Reusable pagination or filtering dependencies
  - **Important:** Show you can reduce duplication using dependencies instead of copying logic.

- **Advanced DI Concepts**
  - Dependency overrides (for testing)
  - Lifespan within dependencies (context managers, `yield`)
  - Caching or singleton-like dependencies (e.g., connection pools)
  - **Important:** For tests, overriding dependencies is a common interview topic.

---

## 5. Data Persistence & DB Integration

- **SQL Databases with FastAPI**

  - SQLAlchemy ORM basics (models, sessions)
  - Creating CRUD operations
  - Using `Session` as a dependency
  - Transaction management
  - **Important:** Many interview exercises: “Build CRUD for a resource with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy”.

- **Async DB Access**

  - **Important:** In production, shared resources (pools, clients) should be managed here.

- **Scheduling & Workers (Out of Process)**
  - Using Celery/RQ/Huey with FastAPI
  - Task queues for heavy workloads
  - Periodic jobs (cron-like schedulers)
  - **Important:** Explain why long-running/blocking tasks should not be done in request handlers.

---

## 8. Advanced Routing & API Design

- **APIRouter & Modular Design**

  - Creating routers per domain (`users`, `items`, `auth`, etc.)
  - Prefixes, tags, dependencies per-router
  - Versioning APIs (`/api/v1`, `/api/v2`)
  - **Important:** Production-grade apps use routers heavily to keep structure clean.

- **Complex Request/Response Patterns**

  - Pagination (limit/offset, cursor-based)
