## 20.6 Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Rushing to Code

**❌ Wrong Approach:**
```
Read problem → Start coding immediately
```

**✅ Right Approach:**
```
1. Read carefully (2 min)
2. Work through examples (3 min)
3. Identify pattern (2 min)
4. Explain approach (3 min)
5. Code solution (20-40 min)
6. Test & optimize (5 min)
```

---

### Mistake 2: Not Practicing Edge Cases

**Critical Edge Cases Checklist:**
```
□ Empty input
□ Single element
□ All same elements
□ Sorted/reverse sorted
□ Duplicates
□ Negative numbers
□ Integer overflow
□ Null/None values
```

---

### Mistake 3: Neglecting Complexity Analysis

**Always State:**
```
Time Complexity: O(?)
- Best case: O(?)
- Average case: O(?)
- Worst case: O(?)

Space Complexity: O(?)
- Auxiliary space: O(?)
- Recursion stack: O(?)
- Total: O(?)
```

---

### Mistake 4: Not Reviewing Solutions

**After Each Problem:**
```
1. Review optimal solution
2. Compare with your approach
3. Learn new techniques
4. Add to problem journal
5. Mark for future review
```
