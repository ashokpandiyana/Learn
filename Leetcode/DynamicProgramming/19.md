## 19.12 Quick Reference Summary

### The DP Master's Toolkit

**When to Use DP**: Optimal substructure + Overlapping subproblems

**Core Patterns**:
1. Linear (1D)
2. Grid (2D)
3. Subsequence (LCS/LIS)
4. Knapsack (0/1, Unbounded)
5. Interval
6. State Machine
7. Tree
8. Bitmask
9. Digit
10. Graph

**Problem-Solving Steps**:
1. Identify if it's DP
2. Define state
3. Formulate recurrence
4. Identify base cases
5. Determine iteration order

**Optimization Checklist**:
- Space: Rolling array?
- Time: Better recurrence?
- Special: Mathematical formula?

**Interview Formula**:
