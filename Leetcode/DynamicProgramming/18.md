## Key Practice Principles

1. **Consistency > Intensity**: 2 hours daily better than 14 hours on weekend
2. **Understand, don't memorize**: Focus on why, not just how
3. **Spaced repetition**: Revisit problems after 1 week, 1 month
4. **Track progress**: Maintain error log and pattern notes
5. **Active learning**: Explain solutions to others
6. **Varied practice**: Mix easy, medium, hard problems
7. **Timed practice**: Simulate interview conditions
8. **Review mistakes**: Every wrong answer is a learning opportunity
9. **Rest adequately**: Brain needs recovery time
10. **Stay motivated**: Celebrate small wins!

**Remember**: Everyone's pace is different. Adjust timeline to your schedule and learning speed!
